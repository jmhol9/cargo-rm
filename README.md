# Cargo-RM
Cargo is a lightweight ORM written in Ruby.

Cargo metaprogrammatically adds semantic classes and methods that translate into SQL queries. Currently, it includes single- and multi-step associations, as well as lazy, chainable queries.

More features comingâ€”watch this space!

## Setup

#### Models
Add model classes as separate files in `app/models`. Declare associations much like you would in a Rails app:

```ruby
# player.rb
class Player < SQLObject
  belongs_to :team
  has_one_through :home_arena, :team, :arena
end
```

```ruby
# arena.rb
class Arena < SQLObject
  has_one :team
end
```

#### Database
Specify your database in `config/database.yml`:

```yaml
SQL_FILE: 'example.sql'
DB_FILE: 'example.db'
```

If you need a new database, create one from the command line

    $ sqlite3 new_database.db

For easy reference, the repo includes a [SQL file](https://github.com/jmhol9/cargo-rm/blob/master/basketball.sql) with example syntax for creating tables and records. For even easier seeding, see [Seeding](#seeding) below.

## Booting

To start your app:

```ruby
> load 'boot.rb'
```

ðŸ’£Kaboom.ðŸ’£ You're ready to go.

All associations and attribute accessors will be in place. Start using `SQLObject` [methods](#methods) right away!

## <a name="methods"></a> `SQLObject` Methods

* `::all` - Instantiates objects for every record in the class's table, and returns them in an array.
* `::first` - Returns an object for the first record in the class's table, when sorted by `id` ascending.
* `::last` - Returns an object for the last record in the class's table, when sorted by `id` descending.
* `::find(id)` - Returns an object for the record with the corresponding `id`.
* `::find_by(param)` - Queries based on a single parameter (e.g., `fname: 'Biff'`) and immediately returns the matching record(s) or `nil`.
* `::where(params)` - Queries based on one or multiple params. Chainable and provides lazy evaluation.
* `::has_one(name, options = {})`, `::has_many(name, options = {})`, `::belongs_to(name, options = {})` - Creates a `name` method to access associated records. As necessary, use `options` to specify a non-conventional `:primary_key`, `:foreign_key`, or `:class_name`.
* `::has_one_through(name, through_name, source_name)` - Creates a `name` method for accessing multistep associations.
* `#save` - Will create new records and updated existing records. Checks `id` to determine persistence.
* `#insert` - Creates a new record.
* `#update` - Saves changes to an existing record.
* `#destroy` - Destroys an existing record.

## <a name="seeding"></a>Seeding

As a convenience, a `SeedUtil` class is included. Use `SeedUtil::csv_seed!` to save a CSV to your database:

```ruby
> SeedUtil.csv_seed!(ModelClass, 'path/to/csv.csv', ["column_one_name", "column_two_name", "column_three_name"])
```

Note that your CSV column names should correspond to the class's attributes. Exclude the headings from the CSV file itself.
